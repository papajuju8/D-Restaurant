                amazing
                food. The vegan sushi is to die for. IT WAS FIRE!! The service we received was so amazing and we will
                definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience.</p>

                food
                and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations.</p>

              <p class="comment">This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really
                friendly.
                They know what they’re doing and what they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy
                is
                their main priority. Food is pretty good, some italian classics and some twists, and for their prices
                it’s
                100% worth it.</p>

                staff
                truly cares about your experience. The food is absolutely amazing – everything we tasted melted in other
                mouths. Absolutely the best meal we had in a while. Highly recommend!</p>

              <p class="comment">When we think about celebrations, D' Restaurant is always our first option and it never
                disappoints. From the starter to the dessert the quality and tastes of everything was outstanding, my D'
                Deviled Eggs, Tofu Burger, and Glissade Chocolate Pudding might have been the best meal I have ever been
                served. Service was delightful and very professional. 10/10</p>

              <p class="comment">Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard.
                Definitely
                fine dining. It can be expensive but worth it and they do different deals on different nights so it’s
                worth
                checking them out before you book. Highly recommended.</p>

              <p class="comment">I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal in D' Restaurant. I had a 3
                course
                meal, with a couple of beers. Considering the quality, the price is reasonable. Ideal for those who want
                a
                romantic night out. There was also plenty of room for bigger groups.</p>

                what I
                order I am always delighted with my meal! Servers are also great and always efficient, happy and polite.
                Can’t wait to return and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to eat.</p>

                stunning, both the appetizers and main course. Cocktails wow, wine great and lovely selection of beers.
                Love
                this place and will continue to visit.</p>
